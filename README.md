## Purpose

[Royal Kludge Keyboards](https://rkgamingstore.com/) are very popular in the budget mechanical keyboard community. Sometimes it is the only viable option for students especially from developing countries like me. However, they are infamous for poor software support.

There are efforts to get 3rd party firmware like [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) to run on some of these keyboards, but not every keyboard is supported. Also there are keyboards with the same model name but different processors. The entire process is risky and not recommended for begineers.

I decided to try another approach to this problem. I reverse engineered the protocol these keyboards use with their default firmware. I did this by using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to capture and observe USB packets sent from my PC to my keyboard after editing settings in the RK Software.

Therefore, instead of changing the keyboard firmware, this software pretends to be "RK Software". There is no risk of bricking your keyboard. It is plug and play!

## Pros over RK Software
- Free and Open Source.
- Cross-platform. Rangoli runs on Linux, Windows and MacOS.
- Start On Boot. You can configure Rangoli to start at system boot and also select a profile to be applied on startup.
- Functional System Tray Icon. Although the RK Software does show up in System Tray, it is very limited and opens up the main window for even basic tasks like selecting a profile. Rangoli offers more functionality, including the ability to apply a profile per keyboard.
- Modern. Far more user friendly and has basic window behaviours including being able to resize, maximise, etc - something which the RK Software lacks.
- Colour Picker. You can select colour of your choice directly from your screen. Hex, RGB, HSV, HSL are also supported.
- Customisable. Rangoli offers users to change it's theme colours and also offers light and dark themes.

## Supported features
- Custom Key Map
- All built-in light modes
- Per key RGB
- Per key LED Brightness, Animation and Sleep

## Planned features
- Music Mode
- Custom RGB Patterns

## Features that will not be worked on
- Macros. This is something that can be done directly on OS level. There are tools like [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and [AutoKey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey) that does this far better than RK Software itself.
- Keyboard Firmware update. I was not able to reverse engineer this aspect of the RK Software because the function itself is broken.

## Supported Keyboards

Full list of supported keyboards can be found [here](https://github.com/rnayabed/rangoli/blob/master/supported-keyboards.md).

## Compile and Run from source

### Prerequisites

- Qt >= 6.4
- CMake >= 3.16
- GCC >= 9.4.0 / Clang >= 5
- Ninja >= 1.10.2

### Clone

Rangoli uses [hidapi](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi). It has been included as a submodule.
Therefore, you need to clone the repository with `--recurse-submodules`.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rnayabed/rangoli.git
```

In case you forget to do that, you need to run the following command:

```
git submodule update --init
```

### Compile 

```
cmake -B build -G Ninja -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
```

### Run
- Linux: `./build/src/rangoli`
- Windows: `.\build\src\rangoli.exe`
- MacOS: `open ./build/src/rangoli.app`
