# Keyboards Support Status List

Below you can check if your keyboard is supported.

**Rangoli currently only supports models with vendor ID `0x258a`.**

It looks like the protocol used for keyboards with VID other than `0x258a` is totally different. Thankfully, for `0x0c45` boards, the reporter of that [issue](https://github.com/rnayabed/rangoli/issues/13) has provided packet captures with detailed context, so you are free to reverse engineer the protocol yourself. At the time of writing this, I really find myself unmotivated to work on it especially because I find it much more obfuscated than the protocol used for `0x258a` boards. Thankfully, a vast majority of the models in the market are `0x258a` protocol based and Rangoli supports most of the RK keyboards in the market.

Note that some keyboards have similar names but [different Vendor and Product IDs](https://github.com/rnayabed/rangoli/issues/14).
